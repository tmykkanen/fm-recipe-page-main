## My process

### Built with

- ![Astro](https://img.shields.io/badge/astro-%232C2052.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=astro&logoColor=white)
- ![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

### What I learned

- I used `::before` for more customized list styling combined with custom css counters for `<ol>`. I haven't used either of these features much before and I learned a lot by reading documentation and some articles on CSS Tricks.
- I did some more reading on semantic html and accessibility.
- I used container queries for the first time. I also used `grid` for layout, following Kevin Powell's really helpful youtube video.

### Continued development

- I'd like to continue learning container queries and `grid` positioning. They both seem quite powerful.
